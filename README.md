# College Football Against the Spread Picker
This project uses machine learning to pick college football games against the spread

# Data Source
We pull data from various sources including
- [College Football Data](https://collegefootballdata.com)

# Goal
The goal is to see if a model can outperform me in my pick-em league and also to just have fun
learning what data a model thinks influence teams' abilities to cover.

I usually finish in the top 1/3 of my league where we pick 15 games a week.

To be continued...
