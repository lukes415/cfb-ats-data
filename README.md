# College Football Against the Spread Picker
This repo is for producing datasets and machine learning models to pick college football games against the spread

# Current Status
Experimentation phase -- trying to build a good dataset and get better performance than my initial 51%

# Data Source
We pull, clean, and manipulate data from:
- [College Football Data](https://collegefootballdata.com)

# Goal
- [ ] Engineer features to predict ATS outcomes using ingested CFB data
- [ ] Create baseline models, evaluate vs. obvious  and try to improve upon them
- [ ] Integrate dataset and models with an iOS app to help users enjoy college football weekends more
- [ ] See if my model can outperform me in my pickem league. I usually come in the top third of the league
- [ ] Have fun :grin:

# In Progress
- [ ] Update the dataset to include conference flags, timezone deltas, and coaching tenure deltas
- [ ] Check how many records are missing specific datapoints and try to decide on reasonable substitutions
